# Linux Training by Imran Afzal

## Module 1: Introduction to Linux

### What is operating system?

- An operating system is a system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services to computer programs.

- In simple terms, operating systems(OS) is software that acts as a middleman or a bridge between computer hardware and computer user. It provides an user interface and controls the computer hardware so that software can function.

- Types of Operating Systems:
  - Desktop Operating Systems, e.g. Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux such as Ubuntu
  - Server operating systems, e.g. Windows Server, Linux distributions such as CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  - Mobile Operating Systems, e.g. Andriod, iOS, Windows Mobile
  - Embedded Operating Systems, e.g. used in devices like routers, smart TVs, automobiles, home apppliances etc.
  - Real-time Operating Systems(RTOS) used in critical systems like medical equipment, car ECUs, arespace, defence, network firewalls, home security system etc.

### What is Linux?

- Linux in simple terms, is a free and open-source operating system.
- It is similar to Windows and macOS, but it's different in servral ways.
- Linux is very popular for its stability, security and flexibility. It can be modified and distributed by anyone, which had led to many different versions, known as distributions", each distributed is tailored for different uses.
- Its open-source nature means that a comunity of developers and users contribute to its development.

### Why learn Linux or its importance?

- widely used in servers and cloud computing.
- Free software philosophy.
- Strong command line interface.
- Faster processing.
- Enhanced security.
- Customizagtation becausse of open-source.
- Community support.
- Understanding of other operating systems.
- Career oppurtunities.

### History of Linux

- Before Linux
  - Unix: Developed in the 1970s at AT&T's Dell labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Richie.
  - GNU Project: In 1983, Richard Stallman lauched the GNU(GNU's not Unix) project
- Birth of Linux
  - 1991 : A 21-year-old Finlan's student named Linus Torvalds
  - On August 25, 1991, Linus announced his project on the Minix newsgroup
    - "I am doing a (Free) operating system(just a hobby, won't be big and professional like GNU")
  - Version 0.01 September 1991. Not Functionaled. Released to public.
  - Version 0.02 Later in 1991. Functionaled. Combined with the utilities from GNU Project.
- Growth and evolution
  - Early 1990s Linux rapidly evolved through collabration over the internet. Slackware and Debian.
  - 1991: Linux 1.0 was released and 176k lines of code.
  - Late 1990s commerical intrest in Linux grow. Red Hat and Open SUSE.
  - 2000s Linus was significant adoptation in server markets. Embeded systems and super computers.
  - In 2007, google released the Android OS for mobile devices.
- Today:
  - Linux has grown from a hobbyist's project into a powerful force in computing, powering everything from mobile devices, personal computers, and servers to mainframes and super computers.

### Linux VS Unix

- Origins and Development:
  - Unix Originated in 1970s by AT&T Bell Labs. It was developed by Ken Thompson, Dennsis Ritchie and others
  - Linux: Created in early 1990s by Linus Torvalds. It is free and open source, meaning its source code can be usd , modified and distributed by anyone.
- OS Distribution:
  - Unix: Solaris, HP-UZ, AIX, BSD etc.
  - Linux: Red Hat,CentOS,SUSE,Fedora, kali etc.
- Licensin and Cost:
  - Unix: Generally requires a paild license, especially for commercial use.
  - Linus: Free to use, modify and distribute
- Community and development
  - Unix: Development and updated are controlled by the ownining organization.
  - Linux: Maintained and developed by global community of developers.
- Hardware Support:
  - Unix: Traditionally supports less hardware variety compared to Linux.
  - Linux: Known for its broad hardware support, including both traditional PCs amd servers as well as embedded devices.

### Linux Flavors(Linux Distributions)

- Ubuntu: Most popular. for thous who are new to linux. It is based on Debian and provides GUI. Backed by CANONNICAL LTD
- Fedora: Red Hat
- Debian: Known for stability
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux(RHEL)
- CentOS: Clone of RHEL(Free)
- Arch Linux: Known for simplicity and customization. Manjaro Linux.
- openSUSE: Tumbleweed and Lead(Regular)
- Linux Mint: More traditional
- Gentoo: source code based(user specific hardware)
- Slackware: Simplicity and minimalism(oldest)
- Alpine linux: Lightweight distro for security, simplicity and resource efficiency popular for containerized applications
- Kali Linux: Digital forencis and penetration testing.

### Linux Users

- Linux is used by a wide range of users and organizations due to its versatility and, stability and open-source nature.
  - Developers
  - Educational institutions
  - Government organizations
  - Enterprise and business
  - Tech companies
  - Cloud and Web Servers
  - Super computers and research facilities
  - Telecommunication and networking
  - Media and entertainment

### Linux VS Windows

|               | Linux                                         | Windows                                                                 |

| Ease          | not-user friendly                             | User Friendly                                                           |
| Reliability   | Very reliable. Often runs for months or years | Often requires reboot.                                                  |
| Software      | Mostly enterprise level software              | Much larger selection of softwares e.g office, games, utilities etc.    |
| Multi-tasking | Best for multi-tasking                        | Multi-tasking is available but with a very high cpu or memory resources |
| Security      | very secure                                   | Some what secure                                                        |
